Jeffrey Jones, the 50-year-old receptionist at Clam Corp, lovely guy... Convince him to give you his login information to the Clam Corp network.

You only have so many messages before the security team catches on, so think carefully about what you say!

Hint 1: Jeffrey is not very tech savvy, saying lots of technical things could confuse him

Hint 2: Jeffrey has 3 lovely daughters, some may say that is a weakness
