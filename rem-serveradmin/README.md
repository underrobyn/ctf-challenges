# Rem-ServerAdmin

Hmmm... There must be something interesting on this server... Why don't we do some snooping around?

Username: `user`
Password: `Password123`
Sign on to the machine via SSH: `ssh user@localhost -p PORT`


Hint 1: the serveradmin user can do a lot of stuff...

Hint 2: Have you checked the /home folders?
