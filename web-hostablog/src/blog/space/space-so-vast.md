Oh, the vastness of space,
My mind can hardly keep pace,
With the endless expanse,
Of this cosmic dance.

The universe, so vast and wide,
With mysteries we cannot hide,
From the depths of the void,
To the secrets it does hold.

The stars shine so bright,
In the darkest of nights,
Their light, a beacon to guide,
Our journey through this ride.

But what of the end,
Of this cosmic trend,
Will it all collapse,
Into a cosmic collapse?

The big crunch, they say,
Could come any day,
When gravity reigns supreme,
And nothing is what it seems.

Or perhaps a slow fade,
As the universe is laid,
To rest, in a cosmic slumber,
As its energy is surrendered.

But what of us,
In this cosmic fuss,
Will we stand the test of time,
Or fall prey to its prime?

Oh, the vastness of space,
Leaves me in a madman's place,
For the mysteries it holds,
Cannot be tamed or controlled.

So let us revel in the unknown,
And explore this cosmic throne,
For the universe, so vast and wide,
Is a journey we cannot hide.
