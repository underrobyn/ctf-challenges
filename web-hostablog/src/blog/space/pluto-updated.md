### \*\*Updated Pluto Content\*\*

## I changed my mind...

Okay so I know that I wrote a post earlier about wanting Pluto to be a planet again, but that was only because a NASA
representative was literally holding me at gunpoint to promote their agenda.

Now that they're gone I can give my honest, unfiltered opinion: why are people so hung up on this stupid debate?! Pluto
is literally a rock in space. It does not care if it's classified as a planet or not. Why do people feel so bad for
Pluto as if it's a stray puppy that got kicked by the IAU?! Pluto literally doesn't even know what status it holds in
children's encyclopedias, nor does it care. It's not sentient! It doesn't have emotions!

And why do people only care about Pluto? What about Eris? Eris is literally the most massive trans-Neptunian object,
it's even chonkier than Pluto! If anyone should be considered a planet - it's her! Eris and Pluto rule the Kuiper belt
together. Pluto went from being considered the smallest and lamest planet to being the king of the dwarf planets, and I
think that's much cooler.

And can we talk about Ceres too for a second? When it was discovered in 1801, it was considered a planet. It was later
classified as an asteroid and then a dwarf planet, but I don't see anyone crying about her losing her status as a
planet! I'm starting to think that the only people who care so much about Pluto's declassification are posers who don't
even know that there are hundreds of Pluto-like objects in the Solar System. I bet they wouldn't be happy if we said "
alright then if you so insist, we will count Pluto as a planet again, and a hundred other asteroids too, good luck
coming up with a new planet song to remember them all!"

AND ALSO, why stop at Pluto and the gang? Why not classify the Galilean moons and Titan and Enceladus as planets too?!
They all have unique atmospheres and chemistry and geography and even have suspected signs of microbial life. Why can't
moons be planets too? Titan and Ganymede are literally bigger than Mercury, the smallest planet! It's pretty
hypocritical to leave them out of the whole planet discussion, just because they're less massive and happen to be
orbiting the more impressive gas giants. And what's so interesting about Mercury anyway?! It's the most boring planet!
It's just a rock! Why don't we declassify it, too?

Although, wasn't there a recent paper that proposed to re-define "planet" to include Pluto, Eris, and some big moons?
Now THAT'S the happy ending we all deserve. Tie up some loose ends, throw in some funky fresh new planets, tie a ribbon
around it, and feed it to the public to distract them from the fact that space isn't even real and the Earth is flat.
